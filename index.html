		<p>The pandemic has caused the number of people to isolate themselves to try to contain the advance of covid-19. One year after the start of the health crisis, isolation is still necessary. With that, technology took a place in the population's lives, with classes and virtual meetings, which served both to maintain social contact and to prevent a complete deterioration of mental health....</p>

				<h2 style="text-align: :underline; color:#0000CD">Importance of technology in combating the COVID-19 pandemic</h2>
				<br>
				<h3>The new coronavirus pandemic is a notorious subject, which has profound implications for health plans. Although there are concerns about its economic, social and health impacts, the moment also opens up room for innovation: more and more talk is being said about the application of technology in the pandemic and in the period that will follow.
				If you work directly in health plans, you have certainly noticed how technology has been consolidating itself as a central pillar at this time. In addition to requiring it in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of the disease, it also permeates our personal and professional relationships.
				In this article, we'll explain how important technology is in the pandemic and how to use it in practice. We'll also explain how joining this trend can be beneficial for health plan operators now and in the coming years. Keep reading to learn more.

				<br>
					<h3>Right from the start of Covid-19, we noticed a significant economic impact derived from the pandemic: current projections predict a drop of around 6.5% in the Brazilian GDP in 2020, a unique value in recent decades. It is due, in part, to the cooling of the economy and the absence from work for health reasons - which does not mean, however, that it is unfounded.
					Social distancing has become a global tool in the fight against Covid-19. The rationale for how it works is simple: we avoid direct contact with infected people and stop the transmission of the coronavirus, which occurs via respiratory particles and droplets. With a less accentuated curve of cases, we run less risk of suffering an overload of the health system, which is unable to attend to everyone at the same time.
					In this sense, technology helps us to obtain and analyze data in real time. With it, we closely monitor our interventions and reliably monitor the growth of the pandemic. In addition, it also allows for remote work, which mitigates the negative impact of social distancing on our economy.
					How have technological solutions been used in this context?
					As mentioned, the application of technology in the pandemic is both direct and indirect. Next, we'll cover the main uses of it at this time. Check out!</h3>

				<h2 style="text-align: :underline; color:#0000CD">Use of technology</h2>
				<br>
				<h3>&#10149;1. Information sharing
				In the history of mankind, no pandemic has had such an efficient collection and cross-referencing of data as that of Covid-19. Quick searches are enough to inform us with real-time news about the number of infected, recovered and deaths from the disease.
				While there is contemporary concern about Fake News, quality information was also boosted during the pandemic: in addition to increasing the number of scientific research, we also created international datasets for sharing data about Covid-19. Maintaining scientific production on this scale in the post-pandemic period, however, will be a challenge worldwide.
				<br>
				<h3>&#10149;2.Tracking infected people
				Data are valuable when guiding effective interventions. This maxim is used by health management — whether public or private — to help control and map the disease.
				This crossing of data is especially important in tracking infected people: for financial and logistical reasons, global population tracking is not a viable alternative in Brazil today. For this reason, we must have specific criteria for testing and screening the infected in order to maximize our results.
				In this sense, technology and data science serve to guide our conduct, from the management office to within the offices. They help us define who, where and when to test, predicting the behavior of the pandemic and populations most at risk. It is also possible to map the cases and spatially understand the speed of spread of the virus.</h3>
				<br>
				<h3>&#10149;3. Vaccines
				Vaccines for the new coronavirus have caught the spotlight as a possible solution to the pandemic. Some countries, such as Russia, have already approved their own vaccines or started mass population testing.
				The production of a vaccine, however, is not an easy task. Under normal conditions, due to the rigor required for its approval, it can take years to be made available to the public.
				In the current pandemic, the quicker emergence of a vaccine may be possible due to two main factors: the first is the urgency of the moment, which focuses our human, financial and technological resources on this discovery. The second is the state-of-the-art technology available in biochemistry laboratories, which speeds up the isolation of viral particles and their conjugation — a process necessary for the final production of the vaccine.</h3>
				<br>
				<h3>&#10149;4. Monitoring of social isolation
				Finally, another technology that has gained space in the media in recent months is the monitoring of social isolation. By partnering with mobile phone networks, it was possible to identify clusters and monitor people's traffic.
				In addition, the approval of telemedicine during the emergency period enabled remote monitoring of patients in isolation. This allows the medical team to closely check the clinical picture, without the risk of contamination from other patients in the emergency room.</h3>

				<br>
				<h3>Virtual patient care
					With social isolation, communication by video calls became frequent. Many medical consultations have been carried out through the virtual service to avoid the contamination of patients in clinics and hospitals. Telemedicine became so important that it was released by the Federal Council of Medicine (CFM) on an exceptional basis during the period of combat against COVID-19. Telemedicine began to be exercised for guidance, referral and monitoring of patients, as well as for the exchange of information between physicians to help with treatments and diagnoses.

To meet this need, the Federal Council of Psychology (CFP) expanded the possibilities of consultations without limit on the number of sessions.</h3>

				<h3>In certain Chinese establishments, the individual must show the QR Code at the entrance. If you have not gone through places with a focus of coronavirus contamination, you can enter. However, there are still concerns about the privacy of these users' data after the pandemic.
				Artificial Intelligence and other technologies
				Some technological trends are no longer just trends and became allies in the fight against Sars-CoV-2. Technological tools such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Big Data, cloud computing and the Internet of Medical Things (]) are some of the resources that can be used to find ways to treat, prevent the spread and even disinformation among the population.
				For example, here in Brazil, the startup Portal Telemedicina developed an artificial intelligence algorithm capable of identifying the disease from X-ray images and chest CT scans. Created with the help of the Google Cloud cloud, the diagnosis is complementary to current exams.
				Also in Brazil, the largest investment by national science, Sirius, had among its first experiments 3D images of protein structures of SARS-CoV-2. The details obtained can help in understanding the virus and in the development or improvement of remedies against COVID-19.
				Automated deliveries
				Delivery services became indispensable, with this, the issue of decreasing contagion between the delivery person and the person who will receive the product also arose. Around the world, some companies are already operating or testing new forms of delivery, such as an electric car without a driver, an autonomous van to deliver medicines in contaminated regions and transport food to workers who work on the front lines against covid-19 .
				Changes that are here to stay
				What we are experiencing, even in the face of so many calamities, is a favorable moment to overcome cultural barriers and the learning curve with the use of some technologies already adopted by the population. The professions of the future have become even more evident – ​​and technology is at the forefront of this new scenario. Stay on the blog and see how museums have also adapted to this new digital age.</h3>
